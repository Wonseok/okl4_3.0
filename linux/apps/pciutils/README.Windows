Since 2.1.99-test5, pciutils should also be compilable on Windows. Thanks
to Alexander Stock for contributing the port.

To build this port, you need to install WinIO.dll first. You can get it
from http://www.internals.com/.

However, you need to use win32/config.h instead of the automatically
generated lib/config.h as lib/configure does not run on Windows.
